Title: RaspberryPi PyCamera Dropbox Observation System
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
This program was created in order to provide up-to-date images for an area of focus, to an easily accessible platform - DropBox. By utilizing the DropBox API, an entire system, of a server, web-connection, and a mobile environment, was easily incorporated, without a great deal of effort, on the creators end. Within this program, a sudo-metering system, a system by which the brightness of an image is dependent on the level of light in an environment, was created. It should be noted, that the metering system developed, was quite basic in design. Only 4 levels of accommodations were provided. 

Note:
In the next version, a better metering system will be developed, and an attempt to upload short videos, rather than images, will be made.
